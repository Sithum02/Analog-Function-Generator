# Function Generator Using Only Analog Components

Welcome to the official repository for the **Function Generator using only analog components**, developed by **SLAP Innovators** as part of our 3rd-semester analog project. This repository contains all the resources and documentation for our project.

## Overview
Our function generator is designed to produce the following waveforms using exclusively analog components:
- Sine Wave
- Square Wave
- Sawtooth Wave
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- Triangular Wave

### Features
- Fully analog design.
- Compact and durable PCB.
- Custom-designed enclosure.
- Supports multiple waveform outputs with adjustable parameters.
